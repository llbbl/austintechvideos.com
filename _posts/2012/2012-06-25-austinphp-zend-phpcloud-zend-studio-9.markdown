<p>Zend will be here! Kevin Schroeder is kind enough to join us this month to go over what's new in Zendlandia.
There were some big announcements at Zendcon last year that we covered briefly in our Nov meeting. This will be a
good chance to take a more in-depth look at phpcloud, Zend Studio 9 and more!</p>
