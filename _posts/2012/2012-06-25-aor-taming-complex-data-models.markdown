<p><em>Taming Complex Data Models — Mason Hale</em></p>
<p>The real-world is rife with complex relationships and arbitrary rules. As developers, we are often faced with
the challenge of modeling and managing these complexities in our applications. In this talk, we’ll delve into some of
the “hairier” complex data-modeling scenarios like hierarchies, N-way relationships, and aggregated data and explore
 some of the patterns and techniques to tame these wild beasts.</p>
<p>Mason Hale is the founder and CTO of TeamTopia, the company behind SwimTopia, the world’s friendliest swim team
management solution. Mason was previously CTO at OneSpot and Chief Technologist at frog design. He has been working
with Ruby on Rails since 2006.</p>
