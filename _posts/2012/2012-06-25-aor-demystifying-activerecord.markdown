<p>For many new Rails developers, their first exposure to Rails (and often Ruby) is through ActiveRecord and
“magical” incantations like ‘hasmany’ or ‘belongsto’. In this talk, we’ll pull back the curtain on ActiveRecord
and see what’s going on under the hood. We won’t assume any prior knowledge of Rails or ActiveRecord, but may skim
over explaining methods and parameters which are already well documented elsewhere. Instead, we’ll focus on the
“big picture”, identifying the main concepts and components and explaining how they fit together.</p>
<p>Anthony Lewis is an Internal Tools Developer at PeopleAdmin. Prior to that he was a
freelance web developer and teacher.</p>
