<p>We're going to look at adding additional content pieces to your WordPress site through custom meta boxes. We'll look
 at doing this through code, not through an admin screen, so it's going to be a technical talk.</p>
<p>How do we create and get these in our admin screens? When we have the fields in place, how do we work with the
new content? Can we use the new content in a query? How do we get the new content to our site?</p>
<p>Sound like fun?</p>
