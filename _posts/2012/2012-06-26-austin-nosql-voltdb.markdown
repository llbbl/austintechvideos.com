<p>On April 17, 2012, VoltDB announced the results of a Node.js benchmark that reached 695,000 transactions per second
for a Node/VoltDB test application. In this talk, VoltDB will review key details of the benchmark, and discuss
practical implications for Node.js developers, including the kinds of Node apps that can benefit by using
VoltDB as a back-end datastore. The talk will include a brief overview of VoltDBâ€™s in-memory architecture;
it will discuss the Node.js client library for VoltDB; and it will provide information about how to get started
building a Node/Volt POC.</p>
