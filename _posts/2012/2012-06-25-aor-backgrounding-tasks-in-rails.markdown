<p><em>Backgrounding Tasks in Rails - Marcus Mateus</em></p>
<p>Frequently web applications need to perform tasks which can take far too long to handle in a healthy request
cycle. Marcus will showcase a few options for moving tasks into the background, enabling quick responses to site
visitors, using libraries like DelayedJob and Resque.</p>
<p>Marcus Mateus is a Austin-based Rails developer and founder of SimpliTex LLC.</p>
