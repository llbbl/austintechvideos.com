<p>Presented by Vitorio Miliano (@vitor_io)</p>
<p>Maybe “better” means more organized, or having more attendees, or doing what your attendees want. Whatever your
goals, Vitorio has practical, actionable suggestions on how to improve the quality of your user group, meetup or
local community. Miliano researched the Austin design community for an essay, “Local Communities In Practice and
By Design.” He’ll share common problems user groups face, ways to discover what your meetup is made of, and how
to use that information to make it better.</p>
