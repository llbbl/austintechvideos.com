<p> It’s hot.  We know. Why not come down to this month’s meetup and learn some cool things from local front-end expert
 and O’Reilly published author, Garann Means!</p>
<p>For those of you not quite familiar with Garann, she is a Senior Frontend Engineer at Etsy, has been building
websites since 1996, and using JavaScript for most of that time (though not always for things that she’s now proud of).
 Garann has spoken at a number of tech conferences and wrote a book on Node.js.</p>
<p>If you know much about the engineering side of Etsy, you’re probably aware that they love their devtools
there. StatsD is one of their better-known tools. It’s an open source Node service that they use to collect
statistics about how the site is working and being used. Garann will talk about the tool itself and about how it
fits into Etsy’s larger process</p>
<p>07.17.2012</p>
