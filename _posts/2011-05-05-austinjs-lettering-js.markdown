<p>This month's meetup we take a step away from the traditionally hardcore, engineering-focused styles talks and presentations and decide to focus back on the user interface and beautifying the web, specifically typography. Neighborhood superstar, Rails aficionado and iOS contemporary Dave Rupert will be discussing and showcasing, Lettering.js.</p>
<p>Web type is exploding all over the web but CSS currently doesn't offer complete down-to-the-letter control. While working on the Lost World's Fairs project for Microsoft and the launch of IE9 Beta, Dave Rupert and team needed that level of control. Thus was born, Lettering.js, a jQuery plugin for radical web typography.</p>
<p>We'll be walking through this simple jQuery plugin line-by-line, talking about the art of releasing a jQuery plugin, and peeking at some real-world use cases.</p>
<p>Dave Rupert is lead developer and 1/3rd of Paravel. He is also the host of the ATX Web Show, a not-so-weekly podcast all about the local web design and development scene here in Austin, TX.</p>
