Talk 2: Debugging, Profiling, Heap Analysis, Scaling and other fix-it techniques in Node.js (1 hr)

When a Node app isn’t making it through the periods of load, how do you get to the root of the problem. Using only open source tools, I’ll show you how to look inside Node, Modules and V8 to discover where the memory or processor is hung up or the data has gotten corrupt or the errors are being thrown. Also I will share some sauce of build, deploy and scaling on demand in production. 

Topics are in the app development lifecycle chronology:

Debugging using Node-Inspector CPU and Memory profiling Node.js apps Heap-Dumps and memory leak analysis Application performance monitoring Log management and aggregation Build and deploy techniques Scaling using cluster management and control
