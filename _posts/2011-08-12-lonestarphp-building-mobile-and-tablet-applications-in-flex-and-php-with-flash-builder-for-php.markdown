<p>The future of computing has a significant focus on making sure that mobile and hand-held devices have access to the same data that is available on a standard web page or desktop app. In this talk we will explore how you can use the new Flash Builder for PHP to build data-aware mobile and tablet applications using Flash/AIR and Flex. We will cover the basics of MXML, ActionScript and implementing remote access calls to a PHP-driven backend solution.</p>
