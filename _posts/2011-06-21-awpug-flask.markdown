  content: ! "Sorry if the audio is weird on this one. I have been messing with some
    additional post processing of the audio to reduce the noise while allowing me
    to normalize the gain. I didn't do as good as a job with the audio on this one
    as Django profiling. \n\nAlso sorry for the banging sounds it is me trying to
    work the mic and the camera at the same time. "
