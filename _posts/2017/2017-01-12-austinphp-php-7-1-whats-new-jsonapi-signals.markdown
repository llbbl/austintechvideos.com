What's new with PHP, 201[7.1] Edition. We got a new version last month and it has already a year since 7.0 was released. Come learn about the new features; orient your objects and type your vars. Ian and Logan will be doing a combined talk this month. In particular Ian has said he will do a deep dive on the 7.1 async signals new feature.

Plus a special guest speaker Ralph Schindler talking about JSONAPI!
