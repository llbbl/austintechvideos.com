This month Patrick Guevara (https://twitter.com/psamg) is giving his talk on Laravel Spark. Spark provides the perfect starting point for your next big idea. Forget all the boilerplate and focus on what matters: your application.

Spark is a Laravel package that provides scaffolding for all of the stuff you don't want to code. Subscription billing? Invoices? No problem. It even takes care of authentication, password reset, team billing, two-factor authentication, profile photos, and more. It's the perfect starting point for your next big idea.
