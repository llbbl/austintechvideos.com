PHPseclib
Presented by Jim Wigginton

Jim Wigginton will be talking this month on the secure communications library, phpseclib. He is one of the authors of the library. phpseclib is commonly used if you ever needed to connect via SSH2 or SFTP or X.509. It also does symmetric key encryption using the following formats: AES, Rijndael, Twofish, Blowfish, DES, 3DES, RC4, RC2.
