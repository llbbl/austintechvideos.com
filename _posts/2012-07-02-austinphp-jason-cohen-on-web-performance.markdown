  content: Ohh..and also...consider rewriting your URL's to include the post name
    for better SEO of the videos  ;)

  content: I had considered doing that, but I ended up liking this better, shorter
    urls and me getting sick of the common WP URL. Although I don't like the way WP
    saves article versions such that the post count seemingly arbitrarily increases
    when it feels like it.. One of the factors of my decision was that I figured the
    videos would spread socially more than search engine + content wise.

  content: Glad you enjoyed it! This entire project is strictly a volunteer effort
    so far and as a result I don't have a ton of time to do stuff like that. I'll
    tell you what, if you want to help, if you post the links in the comments here
    I'll update the body of the article.
