<p>Phase2 Technology maintains 5 distributions: OpenPublish, OpenPublic, OpenAtrium, Managing News and Tattler.
We have shifted our development to center around these distros, using the products as the base for most client
builds, and then customizing according to their needs.<br />
Erik Summerfield, the Technical Lead for OpenPublic, and Karen Borchert, our Product Director, will discuss
how we develop our distros, how we integrate them with client work and where we hope to take them in the future.</p>
