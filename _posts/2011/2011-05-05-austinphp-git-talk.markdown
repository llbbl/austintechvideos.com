<p>This month is all about the popular Distributed Version Control System, Git. Travis Swicegood has written a book on git, Pragmatic Version Control Using Git and here is to provide his expertise on the subject. If you are new to git but familiar with other VCS like SVN or CVS this talk is for you.</p>
<p>Interested in learning how to get started with git? Want to know more about migrating your current SVN or CVS repo to git? Come and see how you can move from beyond the basics with git so you too can be a git samurai slicing and dicing your commits.</p>
