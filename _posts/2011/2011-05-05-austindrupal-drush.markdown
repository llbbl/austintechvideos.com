<p>Chris Ruppel from Four Kitchens will be giving the low down about Drush Make and talking about his awesome new project DrushMake.me, a click-and-point tool for quickly creating custom Drupal installations.</p>
<p>Details</p>
<p>It only takes a few Drupal installs to notice the pointless repetition of the process. First you download Drupal core, then the latest modules, your favorite base/admin themes, other libraries for JavaScript or WYSIWYG editing, and so on... Why should you have to do this over and over? The answer is: you don't.</p>
<p>In this session we'll discuss automating Drupal installations using Drush make. A makefile is a simple, human-readable macro that is executed by Drush. It can save you tons of time and effort!</p>
<p>Coming in to this session you should be comfortable using Drush, or at least understand it. There will be some command line demos.</p>
<p>Coming out of this session you will have:</p>
<p>    Basic understanding of makefiles, their creation, and deployment<br />
    Example makefiles for common types of sites<br />
    A point-and-click generator for makefiles - drop dead simple<br />
    The desire to never install Drupal manually ever again</p>
