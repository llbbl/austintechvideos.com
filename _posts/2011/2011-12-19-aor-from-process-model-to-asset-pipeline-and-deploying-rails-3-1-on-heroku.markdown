<p>In this talk Terence Lee and Chris Continanza of Heroku will take you through how
deployment on Heroku works.
We'll start with the Unix Process Model and show how Heroku's Cedar Platform focuses on
deploying with this process model. Then Terence will cover strategies for deploying Rails 3.1 on Heroku and
how Heroku makes it work.
Chris is on Heroku's Add-ons team and loves a good pull request. Terence is on Heroku's Ruby Build Pack
team and works on Bundler/other OSS.</p>
