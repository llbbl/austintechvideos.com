<p>"We'll go through building a slider that displays content from our site (Post, Pages, Custom Post Types). It's a
mix of PHP, Template Tags, CSS &amp; jQuery. This is an intermediate to advanced-level topic but it's fun!"</p>
<p>Content sliders can be created a number of ways in WordPress. But often times I find myself wishing the plugin or
 method used was just a little bit different. I've gotten to where I write my own. In this meetup, we'll look through
 the basics of writing your own slider.</p>
