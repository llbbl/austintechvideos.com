<p>We're proud to announce that we've got a celebrity joining us for this month's Austin NoSQL. Matthew "Roder"
Heitzenroder of Basho is going to come school us on the undisputed, reigning king of NoSQL*, Riak. Ever wonder how
they do map/reduce or why Dynamo is cool? Don't even know what Riak is yet? August's meeting is your chance to get
your answers to these questions and more.</p>
