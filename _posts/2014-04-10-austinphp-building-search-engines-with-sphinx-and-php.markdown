Building Search Engines with Sphinx and PHP
Presented by Josh Butts

Josh Butts will be giving a talk on building search engines with Sphinx and PHP. We will cover indexing content from your database, simple text searches, and creating faceted navigation. This is an intermediate level talk with more code than slides.
