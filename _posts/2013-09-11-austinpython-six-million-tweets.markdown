6 Million Tweets / Day with 200 Lines of Python

For our September meetup, Andrew Donoho will give a presentation entitled "6 Million Tweets / Day with 200 Lines of Python". 

In his words:
"Every new Pythonista needs to write an app based on something they know. As the author of Retweever for iPad, I know Twitter. Hence, this talk will be a review of how I built a simple system to sit on the Twitter 'sample' REST endpoint and save 6M tweets/day in the NoSQL database Couchbase. After this talk, you will know a bit about Twitter, multi-threaded queuing on I/O based tasks and Couchbase."
