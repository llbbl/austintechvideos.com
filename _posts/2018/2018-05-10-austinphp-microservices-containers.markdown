In this high-level presentation geared toward executives and other decision-makers, Parminder Kocher, author of the newly published book, Microservices and Containers, will break down these potentially game-changing technologies. First, are they right for you? Making the switch to microservices is a large undertaking with a steep learning curve, both operationally and culturally, so it's crucial to assess the risks before taking the plunge. Second, what should you expect if and when you decide to move forward with the shift? Kocher draws from his own personal experience to help you with the transition. By the end of the presentation, you should have a good idea how microservices—particularly when paired with Docker containers—can bring unprecedented agility and scalability to application development and deployment, especially in large, complex projects in which time to market and scalability are paramount.
