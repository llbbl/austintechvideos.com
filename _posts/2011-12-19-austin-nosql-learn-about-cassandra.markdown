<p>For our next meetup on October 5th we've got Tyler Hobbs from DataStax.</p>
<p>Tyler will be talking about Apache Cassandra, a hybrid of Amazon's Dynamo, which offers scalability, simplicity, and availability, with the data model of Google's Big Table, which goes far beyond what a key-value store can offer. This talk will cover Cassandra at a high level and show how it makes real-time queries on big data possible.</p>
