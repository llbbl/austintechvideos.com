HHVM!!! Ian Littman will be presenting about Facebook's HHVM runtime. He'll answer questions about its speed (fast!), its compatibility (good, with some gotchas), its user base (which now includes Wikipedia) and how it measures up against the upcoming elePHPant in the room, PHP 7 in terms of migration path and performance. Included will be a quick tutorial on getting the runtime set up, as well as an overview of Hack, a language that adds a number of programmer productivity features on top of standard PHP that you can run on HHVM.
