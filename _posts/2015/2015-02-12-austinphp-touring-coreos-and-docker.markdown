Touring CoreOS and Docker

This month we will be talking about using Docker in production and the tools that will help get you there. The venerable Boyd Hemphill has a great talk ready for us that will get you up to speed on using Docker!  Service discovery and how to deploy a simple PHP app will be demonstrated. After this talk you will be saying, Docker All The Things!
