<p>Varnish is an HTTP accelerator that you can deploy to take pressure off your Rails applications. In this talk, Eric will give an overview of Varnish and how it is deployed at Mass Relevance to handle events like the President Obama Twitter Town Hall - where over 8000/requests per second were handled successfully.</p>
<p>Eric (a.k.a. @efalcao) is a founder and the Direct of Platform for Mass Relevance. He's an entrepreneurial hacker that bootstrapped a side project into a venture-funded software company. His professional passion is scaling real-time web applications with open source software and the cloud.<br />
