It Was Like That When I Got Here: Steps Toward Modernizing a Legacy Codebase ~ Paul Jones

The codebase at work is absolutely terrible. Itâ€™s a mess of spaghetti that has been around for years and is and completely untestable. Any time you fix a bug over here, a new bug appears over there. In this talk, Paul explains how the code got to be so bad, and gives practical steps on how you can start paying off the technical debt you inherited with your legacy application, all while keeping the system running the whole time.
