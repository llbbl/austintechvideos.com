Matt Land from Sparefoot will be talking about UI/Integration testing!  We will explore the synergy of using jQuery to manipulate the DOM and then translating that back to Selenium. Will also be covering how to deal with iFrames when testing headlessly and other considerations.  Parallel UI testing; XPath; Selectors ... oh my!
