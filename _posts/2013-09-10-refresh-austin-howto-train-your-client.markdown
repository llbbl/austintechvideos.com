<P>(Matt Riopelle, Digital Project Designer, @mattriopelle) 
We all know well that there's no such thing as a perfect project or a perfect client. But if you find yours more frustrating than fun, more pain than profit, then it might be time for some client training. In this session, learn to teach your clients how to work with you and gain control over your projects. Matt will cover the hidden deals you make that cost you time and money, the behaviors that undermine your credibility and process, and what every client really wants out of the project.  </P>
