<p>Mike's talk will focus on the fundamentals of JavaScript the language. Think you know it all? We guarantee you will learn something new, unless you are @andrewdupont BECAUSE HE KNOWS ALL #dupontCAPS. Moreover, the introductory talk with cover things like function hoisting and closures, but even simpler topics like basic expressions. Noobs are certainly welcome so if you are one or know someone, be sure they attend. The presentation will be a quick one, so feel free to chime in while Cravey runs the show.<br />
