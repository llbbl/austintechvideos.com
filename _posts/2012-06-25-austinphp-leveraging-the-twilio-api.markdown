<p>Keith Casey will be speaking this month on the Twilio API.</p>
<p>Generally, when we design of User Interfaces, we think of color, alignment, and pixels. Unfortunately there are times when you can't use a browser or it just doesn't make sense. So what if we broke the UI out of the visual realm and into the audio? In this session, we'll use our phones to both a navigate and consume a website. Specifically, we'll use the Twilio API to connect, explore, and use a website.</p>
