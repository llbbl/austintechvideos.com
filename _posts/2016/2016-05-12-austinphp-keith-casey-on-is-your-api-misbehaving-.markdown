Most API testing is a joke. We have things that resemble Unit Tests which are really integration tests which really just wrap our personal understanding in just a bit of code. And at the end of the day, we’re still not sure it works.

In this talk, we’ll dive into some of the benefits of Behavior Driven Development and walk through some examples.
