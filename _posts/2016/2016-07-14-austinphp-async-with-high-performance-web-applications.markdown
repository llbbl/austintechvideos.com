Ian Littman on using Async with High Performance Web Applications

Need to wring more performance our of your app? Have high-quality code? You may want to run it as a long-running web service. Under normal circumstances, you would end up in a callback pyramid of doom, but through the clever use of generator systems, such as AMPHP and Icicle, you can make building asynchronous code (the backbone of a long-running PHP web server) reasonably sane. We will learn how these systems use generators and how to build logic on top of these packages to build blindingly fast, maintainable apps.
