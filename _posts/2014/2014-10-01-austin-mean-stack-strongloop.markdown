Talk 1 : Nodejs and the Advent of iPaaS (1 hr)

Not long ago, it was common for software architects to take a one "one-size-fits-all" approach, using Java 
based products on the front end, back end, and everywhere in between.  Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) 
and enterprise application integration (EAI) products typically used Java and peer technologies such as XML 
to integrate legacy systems.  Yet another set of Java based products were used to externalize the integrated
data into APIs.  These endeavors fell short because of the complexity introduced by the sheer number and 
highly heterogenous nature of legacy data and services.  This further makes externalization equally 
difficult when trying to use a cocktail of Java products.  The world is moving toward the cloud—both public 
and private clouds—and infrastructure demands are giving rise to a new generation of integration platform-as-a-service
(iPaaS) API servers which specifically handle this use case with the added dimension of cloud versus your 
own datacenter. Node.js is powering these new iPaaS products because it's dynamic, highly scriptable, and 
high-performance.  Node hits the sweet spot because it enables developers to glue together disparate pieces 
of legacy infrastructure and quickly surface an API for next-generation web and mobile applications.  
Ultimately, it promises to address emerging requirements for the internet of things (IoT).
