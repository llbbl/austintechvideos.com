PHP Anti-Patterns

Presented by Josh Butts

Most programming conferences these days have a talk on object-oriented design patterns. Everyone is happy to tell you how you SHOULD be writing code. In this talk we will cover how NOT to write PHP. I've scoured the internet for examples of common pitfalls for PHP developers from beginner to advanced. We'll take a lighthearted yet serious look at issues like security, performance, code style, quirks of the language, and more.
