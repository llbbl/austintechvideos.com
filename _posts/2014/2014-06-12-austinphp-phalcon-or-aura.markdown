Aura vs. Phalcon - Two Library Collections You Should Know About

Presented by Ian Littman

Phalcon is a framework built as a PHP extension. Aura is a bunch of loosely coupled user-space PHP libraries. Both are new, standards-compliant and potentially good foundations on which to build your next app. Ian (@iansltx) has built real-life APIs with both, so his presentation's comparisons and contrasts will have a good bit of real-world experience mixed in.
