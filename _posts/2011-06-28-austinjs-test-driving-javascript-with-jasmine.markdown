<p>We also have Austin local via Chicago, Tim Tyrrell chatting up Jasmine, the uber-cool JavaScript unit testing framework.</p>
<p>Test-Driving Javascript with Jasmine -- There seems to be a tendency for developers to do an excellent job of unit testing their server-side code but leaving client-side javascript as the new "spaghetti" dumping ground and it doesn't have to be that way! Jasmine is a nifty Javascript BDD testing framework with a RSpec-like syntax that easily integrates with vanilla JavaScript, jQuery plugins, and even Rails applications.</p>
