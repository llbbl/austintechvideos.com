<p>As the size of our Rails applications grow, so does the complexity. We'll cover some common mistakes encountered in Rails and how to avoid them. Antipatterns are what people use whenever best practices are ignored. Learn how to identify when you're using them and improve your code.</p>
<p>Richard (a.k.a. @schneems) works for Gowalla, Richard writes open source projects like Keytar and JohnnyCache. He teaches Rails classes at UT and CabForward. He has exactly 1 line of code in Rails 3.1, ask him about it.<br />
