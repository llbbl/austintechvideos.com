<p>Presented by Christopher Schmitt (<a href="http://twitter.com/teleject">@teleject</a>, founder of Heatvision)
at Refresh Austin.</p>
<p>The open web doesn't stop at our desktop. Smart phones and tablets not only contain more computing power
and better browsers than the computers that started the Internet economy, they have better displays. In this session
 presented by Christopher Schmitt, we work through tips and tricks to develop future friendly
 images in our sites and apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Icon fonts with breeze and accessibility</li>
<li>Setting up Mobile icons and bookmarks</li>
<li>Using SVG to streamline performance</li>
<li>The fall and rise of JPEG image format</li>
<li>...and much more!</li>
</ul>
