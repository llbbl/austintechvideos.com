<p>Presentation by Ben Brown (CEO XOXCO, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/benbrown">@benbrown</a>)</p>
<p>What happens to your content when it falls off the front page? How can we as web publishers do a better
job of merchandising our content? Brown will explore methods for building more value for readers and publishers
by using reader aware design techniques, and by re-imagining content archives as a back catalog.</p>
