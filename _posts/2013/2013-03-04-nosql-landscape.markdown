<p>As recent applications have faced the demands of the mobile and social space, the limitations of the
relational database model have surfaced. NoSQL database technologies have emerged to enable the cost-effective
management of data behind modern virtualized or cloud infrastructures and mobile applications. From distributed
key/value stores to document-oriented, these modern databases are providing developers with low-cost alternatives
to achieving massive scale and flexibility. This talk will introduce NoSQL taxonomies and the popular databases in
each category. NoSQL application development will be covered by exploring Couchbase Server and its client libraries.</p>
