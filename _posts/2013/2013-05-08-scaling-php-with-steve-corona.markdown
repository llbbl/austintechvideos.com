<p>Twitpic CTO Steve Corona talks (remotely) about scaling PHP web applications.</p>
<p>Steve is CTO at Twitpic, the first photo sharing app for Twitter. Steve dropped out of college and
learned how to scale Twitpic to over 35 million users and billions of photos- sleeping next to his laptop to
 restart Apache in the middle of the night at times. Steve loves to talk about PHP, Scaling, Linux, the Cloud, and NoSQL.</p>
<p>Steve is also a self-published author and has written a book on Scaling PHP Applications (http://scalingphpbook.com).
He also blogs weekly at http://stevecorona.com.</p>
