<p>You've probably heard of Node by now, but it may be sitting in a long list of new tools you want to try. If so,
here's a new year's resolution you can keep: "Learn Node before Valentine's Day." Let Joe LeBlanc guide you through
setting up a Node server, from the perspective of a PHP developer. Learn how both systems manage packages,
handle sessions, pass along requests, and render responses. Joe will map an approach Node if you're used to a
PHP framework, as well as discuss ways you can even use Node and PHP together.</p>
