<p>David Tulig's talk will start by going over the components of the Google Closure Tools. This will cover the
templates, which are usable on both the client and server, the library, which comes with a dependency management
system and a large set of utilities, and the compiler, which performs advanced optimizations to speed up your
JavaScript and reduce the size of the final application. Heâ€™ll then go into detail on how Indeed has leveraged
those tools to build resume instant search, covering using the closure tools in development, discussing the
architecture that drives the product, and the advantages gained by using the closure tools.</p>
