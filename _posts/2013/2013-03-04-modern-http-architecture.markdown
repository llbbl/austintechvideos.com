<p>From the Austin Web Architecture Group</p>
<p>HTTP is no longer simply powering browsers talking to servers sending static pages of HTML. HTTP is carrying HTML
to dumb browsers, JSON back to single-page apps or mobile apps, and is now pushing data to clients of all stripes.
This talk introduces you to architect your infrastructure in a way to make sure that you can meet the needs of tomorrow.</p>
