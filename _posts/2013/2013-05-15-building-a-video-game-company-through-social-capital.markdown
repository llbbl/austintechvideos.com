<p>by <a href="http://twitter.com/jolammert">Jo Lammert</a>, White Whale Games studio director</p>
<p>White Whale Games started in summer of 2011 when Jo Lammert and two friends, spurred by a conversation about
pulp fantasy and video games, decided to make a game company. Each member of the team had little to no experience
in the industry, and the new company had next to no money; So how exactly did White Whale go from chatting about
wizards and swords to releasing the critically-acclaimed God of Blades? Learn about the team's struggles and successes
in indie game development--and how they were able to build a game studio with just a few ideas
and an eagerness to learn.</p>
<p>NOTE: We're missing a few seconds of video a few minutes in. Sorry about that. Everything else is there.</p>
