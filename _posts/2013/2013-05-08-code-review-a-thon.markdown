<p>Keith Casey moderated a live code review. The event was lightly attended due to a certain holiday, but multiple code
reviews were still made, and coding principles discussed.</p>
<p>Four types of things to look for:</p>
<p>Logical/Fundamental issues - Obviously this includes syntax errors - there were none - but also things related
to the proper flow and functionality of the class.</p>
<p>Security/Performance issues - Just because code works as designed doesn't mean it doesn't do other things you don't
want it to. Or to put it more coherently: the code should accomplish the desired task and no more while using the
required resources efficiently.</p>
<p>Best Practices/Standards - This is somewhat of a squishy subject. There are numerous competing coding standards
out there and they're competing for valid reasons. Luckily, Best Practices are relatively clear and becoming more established.</p>
<p>Style/Preference Choices - This is the squishiest point of all. This starts to touch on the design of the code
versus the rest of the system, whether the code should support multiple [choose one: operating systems, databases,
http functionality] which really only matters if the code is supposed to be re-distributable.</p>
