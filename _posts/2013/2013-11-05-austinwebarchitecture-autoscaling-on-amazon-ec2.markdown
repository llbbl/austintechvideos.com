Amazon Web Services' Auto Scaling service allows you to get the most out of your infrastructure. With it, you can provision EC2 instances when you need them, terminate them when you don't, and even recover quickly from failures. In this talk, Matt will discuss the tools and techniques you'll need to get started, as well as auto-scaling strategies we use at Mass Relevance to handle our very dynamic workloads.

Matt Swain has been doing Ops for large web applications for over 10 years at companies including The University of Texas, Symantec, and PeopleAdmin. He currently does his computering as Mass Relevance.
