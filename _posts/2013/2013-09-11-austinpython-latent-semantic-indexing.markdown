Using Gensim to do Latent Semantic Indexing of Text

Marian Nodine will give a short talk about using Latent Semantic Indexing for topic discovery, as a more advanced approach for textual data mining beyond just TF-IDF and term counts.  She will introduce Latent Semantic Indexing, show how to use the GenSim package to find topics and analyze documents, and showcase an example of using this to make more accurate predictions in a specific machine learning problem.
