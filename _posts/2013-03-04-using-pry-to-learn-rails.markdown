  content: ! 'At around minute 13 in this presentation I encountered some unexpected
    behavior around setting variables inside of objects in rails which are unexplained
    in the video.  Upon seeing that portion of the video the creator of Pry (John
    Mair https://github.com/banister)  helpfully tweeted the answer to the conundrum
    to me:  ''title="foo'' didnt work inside Post context is because without self.title=
    it defines a local variable"'
