High performance Yii

Presented by James Nolan

Frameworks are a great way to save on code and speed development.  However, when a project moves beyond the demo stage, there are huge drawbacks to lugging around a giant codebase for every interaction with a given page. Will go over one approach to solving this problem.  This meeting will cover our particular puzzle, testing methodology and solutions to meet their performance criteria.
